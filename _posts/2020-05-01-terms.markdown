For example you might have to store terabytes of information and process them so you choose a tech and set it up so that your Data Scientist can run programs on top of this setup without having to worry about the hassles of engineering the setup and maintain the complexities involved.

It might be marketing or sales decisions. He requires a combination of all skills from programming to utilization of visualizing skills to draw down conclusions.
